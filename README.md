# blankteam-OPS
Currently the Yankees OPS through a 2 week period in the 2022 season but can be any team of any period of time if inputed. 
Simply add dates of your choice to the line of code: batting_stats_range("2022-05-01", "2022-06-01")
Then select team of choice in line of code: newyork_df = data.loc[data['Tm'] == 'New York'], replace 'New York' with any other team
Enjoy!
